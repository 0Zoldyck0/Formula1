        <p><a href="https://www.formula1.com/">Formula One</a> is the highest level of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the <a href="https://www.fia.com/">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)</a>. Since its inception in 1950, the World Drivers' Championship, which became the <a href="https://www.fia.com/">FIA</a> Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the world's premier forms of racing. The name's formula refers to the set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of Grands Prix held around the world on purpose-built circuits as well as closed public roads.</p>
        <p>At Grands Prix, a points system is used to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers and one for constructors. Each driver must have a valid Super Licence, the FIA's highest class of racing license. The races must take place on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade awarded by the FIA.</p>
        <p>Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, thanks to extremely high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of significant amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Much of this downforce is generated by the front and rear wings, which also cause severe turbulence behind each car. Turbulence reduces the downforce generated by a car directly behind, making overtaking difficult. The cars have undergone significant changes for the 2022 season, including increased use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier. The cars rely on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were banned for the first time in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001 before being banned in 2004 and 2008, respectively.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and 1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first non-championship races taking place that year. The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before World War II, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947. The first world championship race took place at <a href="CIRCUITS.HTML">Silverstone</a> in the United Kingdom in 1950. Giuseppe Farina, in his Alfa Romeo, won the first World Championship for Drivers in 1950, narrowly defeating his teammate <a href="JMF.HTML">Juan Manuel Fangio</a>. However, Fangio won the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles stood for 45 years until Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's streak was interrupted (after an injury) by two-time champion <a href="ASC.HTML">Alberto Ascari</a> of Ferrari.</p>
        <p>A championship for constructors followed in 1958. Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to compete regularly, he was never able to win the world championship and has been described by The Independent as "The greatest driver to never win the world championship". In a seven-year span between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished as championship runner-up four times and in third place the other three times. Fangio, however, achieved the record of winning 24 of the 52 races he entered – a record that holds to this day. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula One events were held by promoters for many years. However, due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983.</p>
